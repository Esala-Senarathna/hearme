              <div class="survey-top-para">
                According to the WHO, approximately 466 million people worldwide
                have disabling hearing loss, which represents about 6.1% of the
                world population. [1] Among those people, most of the people
                with hearing impairments can hear after getting an implant or
                after starting to use a hearing aid. But those people still tend
                to use sign language for communication because they do not have
                an improved vocabulary. Vocabulary development is mostly
                affected in between the age of 3 to 6 years. [2] Which is why a
                customized tool for hearing impaired people who are recovering
                is needed. <br />
                The aim of this research is to develop a learning tool to
                provide the ability to use visual based materials from the
                surrounding environment to improve vocabulary in early ages.
                CEHIC worked in collaboration with us the entire period of the
                research and the tool is developed under their supervision.
                Furthermore, this tool has four main areas of development. It
                will initially discover the level of the student each day when
                they try to use the application. Then the student can explore
                what’s around the child through the camera, which enables
                seamless and effective learning experience for the child to
                interact with his surrounding environment and learn based on
                them, after that it generate meaningful sentences and phrases
                from the objects that observed previously and the words they
                have learnt. Finally, lip reading training which basically
                involves with training lip movements for the alphabet and that
                gives visual feedback while monitoring the mouth movements of
                the child.

              Fig 4 illustrates the overall system diagram of the proposed
              solution which was intended to provide a smart approach for
              stakeholders, researchers, and the contributors from CEHIC who
              were working with us in collaboration. Using a mobile app with
              gamified tasks and explorative learning this application proposes
              a method which can improve language and cognitive abilities of a
              hearing-impaired children who are recovering. It was observed that
              all the models perform with performance with better than 84%
              accuracy. The application should be used in the field for many
              years to gather its real impact on the students. The research work
              is done based on English language and further extension can be
              taken to do the enhanced the visual learning to other languages.
              Currently the models are compatible with mobile versions and
              further enhancement related to increase the compatibility of
              mobile phones can be done. The learning process is currently done
              with the supervision of a teacher on premises. But further
              improvements can be made to accommodate remote learning.
